In fact, since mid-2022, Viacom18 has been collecting several properties that once had a home at Disney in India—whether it is the IPL digital rights, rights to bilateral India cricket matches or HBO content.', 'Vivek Menon, Managing Partner of media and entertainment debt fund NV Capital, notes that Disney has encountered a turbulent period on the global stage over the past few years. The company’s stock price has plummeted from a peak of $200 to about $100 now. “In India, they needed to pump additional capital because of the high cash burn on IPL broadcasting rights and Cricket World Cup rights on digital. A merger fits their strategy to conserve cash as well as dilute their holding to raise capital from their India franchise,” he adds. The merger marks Disney’s fourth avatar in India, following partnerships with the K.K. Modi Group in 1993 and Ronnie Screwvala’s UTV Software Communications in the mid-2000s. Disney’s expansion continued with the acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2018 for $71 billion, incorporating Indian operations under Disney Star (earlier Star India).', 'Analysts say the combined FY23 revenue of Rs 25,000 crore, which gives the merged company a 40% market share in linear TV and OTT sectors, could draw scrutiny from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) as the entity will become the single largest player in the field. The merger also reinforces their dominance in sports, with rights valued at nearly Rs 55,000 crore for major cricket properties over the next four to five years, projecting an 80-90% share of cricket advertising revenues in India. The deal also comes just before the commencement of IPL’s 2024 edition.', 'Uday Sodhi, former head of SonyLIV and Founding Partner of Kurate Digital Consulting, says JioCinema has aggregated content from HBO and NBC Universal. The merger will add Disney content also to the mix, he says, as the JV now has the licence to more than 30,000 Disney content assets. “This is great for the consumer. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and the other OTT players will have to now face a stronger competitor and will have to up their game,” he adds.', 'This is the second big-ticket merger in the Indian media and entertainment sector, following the high-profile announcement of a deal between Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (ZEEL) in September 2021. However, the Zee-Sony merger ultimately fell through last month, after numerous twists and turns.', 'Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

Thus, given its fully backward integrated 20GW module capacity, Reliance Industries needs a valuation re-rating for its New Energy business, analysts said.', '   Nuvama Institutional Equities raised its target price on Reliance Industries shares by 5% to  ₹3,105 per share by rolling forward RIL’s New Energy valuation to FY26E sales. It has a ‘Buy’ rating on the RIL shares.', '   Reliance Industries has strategically invested in ten global technology innovators across New Energy verticals.

It is now ascribing a rich valuation to JIO and Retail seeing their huge potential while remaining positive on the core O2C business (both refining and chemicals).\\xa0', '   “We believe refining margins in Asia would rise due to a ‘paradigm shift in regional refining dynamics’ from West to East, which are favourable for a complex refiner like Reliance.

EBITDA margin saw a mild growth of 10bps YoY to 50.4 per cent, RIL said.\\n   The company said Jio\\'s operating revenue growth continued to be driven by robust subscriber growth across mobility and homes, and the benefit of mix improvement in ARPU (average revenue per user).\\n   ARPU increased 2 per cent YoY to  ₹181.7 with a better subscriber mix partially offset by unlimited data allowance on the 5G network.

Ebitda for the quarter stood at Rs 44,678 crore, up 16.7 per cent YoY while Ebitda margin at 18 per cent were up 210 basis points YoY.', 'RIL technical outlook', 'Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart said Reliance Industries has broken out of a multi-month consolidation pattern with a bullish Glag formation near its 20-day moving average (DMA).', '\"This technical setup suggests the potential for further upside towards the Rs 2,900 level. However, options data hints at some resistance near the Rs 2,800 strike price, as call writers seem confident at that level. Therefore, a decisive break above Rs 2,800 would be needed to overwhelm these call writers and fuel further gains. On the downside, the 20-DMA at 2650 acts as a strong support level,\" Meena said.', 'Also read: Top stocks of the week: IRFC, Rail Vikas Nigam, ONGC, Polycab India and more', 'Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

      "paragraphs: [\"Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), joined the elite club of centi-billionaires - global tycoons having a net worth of at least $100 billion. Ambani's wealth swelled after Reliance Industries Ltd hit new record highs on Thursday and other group companies rose sharply of late.\\nAccording to the data available with Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Mukesh Ambani added $2.76 billion in the previous trading session as his wealth stood at $102 billion. He currently stands at 12th spot. Mexican business magnate Carlos Slim is merely $1 billion ahead of Ambani. Bloomberg's Billionaires Index has only a dozen centi-billionaires.\\nShares of Reliance Industries gained about 3 per cent to Rs 2,724.95 during Thursday's trading session, before eventually settling at Rs 2,718.40, up 2.58 per cent. The total market capitalisation of RIL stood Rs 18.40 lakh crore mark. The stock is up 5 per cent in the last two trading sessions, while it has gained 12 per cent in the last one month.\\nRecently, the demerged NFBC Jio Financial Services (JFSL) also added to the recent rise in Mukesh Ambani’s fortunes. The NBFC gained more than 4.6 per cent to close Rs 251.50 on Thursday, with a total market capitalisation close to Rs 1.6 lakh crore on BSE.\\nOther listed entities from Ambani's kitty have also been on  a roll lately. Network18 Media Investment Ltd advanced another 10 per cent on Thursday to close at Rs 130.81. The media counter has rallied about 45 per cent in the year 2024 so far.\\nTV18 Broadcast Ltd managed to end higher on Thursday. The stock has gained more than 20 per cent in the last five trading sessions, with its mcap surpassing Rs 11,100 crore mark.  Similarly, Reliance Industrial Infrastructure Ltd (RIIL) gained over 7.2 per cent to Rs 1515.65. The stock is up about 35 per cent in a month.\\nFollowing the demerger of JFSL from RIL, Investors at Dalal Street are keenly awaiting the primary offerings of Reliance Retail and Jio Platforms, which have been hinted by Ambani in his speeches in the last few AGMs of the company.

At present, it has almost reached the previous peak zone of Rs 2,630 level, where it can find some resistance. The near-term support would be maintained near Rs 2,470 zone and only a decisive breach below this zone shall weaken the overall bias. At the same time, a decisive breach above the previous peak zone of Rs 2,630 should trigger a breakout for fresh targets of Rs 2,730 and Rs 2,850 levels, respectively, in the medium-term time frame,” said Koothupalakkal.

Reliance Industries reported a 29.7% rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 19,878 crore in Q2 from a year ago, despite a dip in revenue from its oil-to-chemicals business.

', 'Besides, the foreign brokerage in a recent note said the O2C segment will benefit from strong global oil demand growth of over 1.2mn b/d in 2024 and upstream has ramped up strongly and will continue its strong performance in FY25.', 'RIL will further benefit from its robust FCF generation of Rs 30,000 crore in FY25F, declining capex levels to about Rs 1.25 lakh crore and declining debt levels to Rs 2.7 lakh crore, Nomura India said.', '\"The latest breakout in the oil and gas index has propelled the sector into positive territory. The recent consolidation in the Nifty Oil and Gas index concluded with an upside breakout, indicating an increased optimism in the space that may persist in the coming days. Therefore, the sudden surge in energy stocks might continue to bolster the headline index in the short term,\" said Rupak De, Senior Technical  Analyst, LKP Securities.', 'Also read: Hot stocks on January 29: IREDA, SBI Cards, IRB Infra, IRFC and more    ', 'Also read: Adani Enterprises: Here’s what to expect from Adani group shares a year after Hindenburg report ', 'Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

      "paragraphs: ['Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) fell less than 1 per cent lower on Saturday, with the most-valued stock on Dalal Street losing Rs 13,400 crore in market capitalisation for the day, as investors turned cautious at the fag end of the session. A couple of brokerages tracking the stock have target prices in the range of Rs 2,900-3,200.  The scrip settled at Rs 2,715.25 on BSE, down 0.72 per cent.', 'Centrum Broking said Reliance Industries’ Q3FY24 operating performance was marginally muted sequentially impacted by subdued performance by O2C segment, which was made up by good performance by other segments, particularly the Oil & Gas segment.', '\"Lower fuel cracks and polymer deltas led to 13.6 per cent QoQ drop in O2C Ebitda, further impacted by lower throughput due to planned shutdown during the quarter. Increase in Oil & Gas production led to 21.8 per cent QoQ and 49.6 per cent surge in Oil & Gas segment Ebitda. Jio Platforms (Digital) added 11.2mn new subscribers, highest in recent quarters while ARPU remained flattish. Capex momentum subsided substantially QoQ. 5G rollout was completed in Q3 as planned,\" it said.', \"The domestic brokerage maintained its 'BUY' on Reliance Industries with a target price of Rs 3,299 from Rs 3,330 earlier.

Telecom and retail are likely to drive earnings over the next two years.', '\"RIL announced the start-up of new energy factories by the end of the current year, clearing the likely announcement of its next phase of investment. Maintain BUY with a target of Rs 3,005,\" the brokerage said.', \"Antique said while O2C performance was weak, the big jump in oil & gas along with the strong retail, and to some extent telecom performance made up for the sequential decline. RIL's third quarter profit was largely in line with its estimates, it said.\", \"Prabhudas Lilladher said the RIL stock is trading at 10.8 times FY26E Ebitda. It maintained its 'Accumulate' rating on the stock with a target of Rs 2,912, valuing the standalone business at 7.5 times FY26 Ebitda, Jio at 15 times FY26 Ebitda and Retail at 39 times FY26 Ebitda.\", 'Meanwhile, Emkay Global said Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) quarter results were largely in-line with its estimates. It said oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business and Reliance Jio Ebitda, both saw a slight miss on estimates but were offset by better Upstream and in-line Reliance Retail numbers.', '\"We broadly maintain FY24-26E earnings, but raise our SOTP-based target price by 8 per cent to Rs 2,950 per share, on the back of higher new energy value (1.5 times EV/IC) as development progresses (giga factory commission, green H₂ PLI win for 90ktpa, etc), higher Jio EV/Ebitda target (11 times versus 10.5 times earlier on strong subscriber growth, peer rerating), and rollover to December 2024 earnings estimates,\" it said while suggesting an \\'ADD\\' rating on the stock.', 'Also read: Top stocks of the week: IRFC, Rail Vikas Nigam, ONGC, Polycab India and more', 'Also read: RVNL shares hit 10% upper price band; check revised target price & other details', 'Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

RIL said it restated figures for the year-ago period to reflect demerger of financial services business.', 'Ebitda for the quarter came in at Rs 44,678 crore, up 16.7 per cent YoY, with Ebitda margin at 18 per cent, up 210 basis points YoY.', 'Reliance Industries said its O2C Ebitda was weak because of planned maintenance and inspection shutdown. Reliance Industries said its Revenue for JPL increased 11.4 per cent YoY, led by robust subscriber growth across mobility and homes, and benefit of mix improvement in ARPU.', 'Revenue for Reliance Retail grew 22.8 per cent YoY with strong growth across all consumption baskets. Grocery reported 41 per cent growth, followed by Fashion & Lifestyle (28 per cent) and Consumer Electronics (19 per cent). O2C revenue declined 2.4 per cent, primarily on account of lower price realisation led by 5.3 per cent Yo-Y decline in average brent crude oil prices. Revenue from Oil & Gas segment jumped significantly mainly on account of higher volumes partly offset by lower gas price realisation from KG D6 field.', 'RIL said its key Ebitda growth contributors included a 11.5 per cent YoY increase in JPL Ebitda with higher revenue and increase in margins. The oil-to-telecom major said Reliance Retail recorded 31.1 per cent increase in Ebitda led by record footfalls amid festive season. Ebitda margin for the Mulesh AMbani-led company improved 50 basis points to 8.4 per cent, thanks to operating leverage and continued focus on cost management initiatives.', '\"Sustained performance in the O2C segment with higher gasoline cracks and advantageous feedstock sourcing. This was partially offset by lower downstream chemical margins and planned maintenance and inspection shutdown. Planned maintenance and inspection shutdown of CDU, FCCU, Delayed Coking and ROGC complex impacted yields and profitability.

RIL shares ended at Rs 2649.95 level, up 2.69% in the previous session on BSE. The stock saw high turnover of Rs 119.81 crore on BSE after 4.58 lakh shares changed hands on BSE. RIL stock has risen 12.24% in a year. It has seen low volatility in one year with a beta of 0.3.  ', 'Market cap of Reliance Industries rose to Rs 17.92 lakh crore on BSE.

It believes that the stock is headed towards Rs 3,050 from medium term perspective being measuring implication of March 22-July 23 range added to Rs 2,600.', 'ALSO READ: Stocks to watch out for today: TCS, Dhunseri Ventures, Metro Brands, Safari and more', '\"The stock has been out of limelight for over two years, as it digested strong rally during 2020-21. It is now poised to conclude this consolidation and expected to lead Nifty in 2024. Structurally, the corrective phase over past two years has retraced preceding 18 month rally by just 38 per cent over past 26 months, indicating robust price structure,\" the brokerage said.  ', 'Morgan Stanley has assigned a target of Rs 2,821 for the stock. It sees multiple triggers to reverse the past nearly two years of earnings downgrade cycle. In its India Equity Strategy Outlook 2024, the global brokerage added Reliance Industries to its focus list.', 'The RIL management commentary on \"peak net debt\" in FY24, funding all of its investments from operating cash flow (OCF), and a slowdown in capex intensity in 2024, all point to increasing focus on de-gearing balance sheet, said  Morgan Stanley.', '\"Other catalysts that could help de-gear and help the stock catch up with peers on multiples include: potential hive off for warehouses in retail and significant ramp-up in retail revenues esp. grocery; inventory restocking for chemicals in India; tightening in global fuel markets, as China caps domestic refining capacity until 2025; and gas/oil production step up – all key to NAV expansion as net debt unwinds with higher OCF, despite our $17 billion annual investment forecast for the next three years,\" the brokerage added.', \"Jefferies has maintained its BUY stance on the Reliance Industries stock. In its report, Jefferies highlighted the company's favourable valuation while maintaining the rating. Jefferies has assigned a price target of Rs 3,125 on Reliance Industries shares.  \", 'The report sees a robust 13 per cent EBITDA growth for Reliance Industries in FY25. The report said that Jio, a telecom subsidiary of Reliance Industries, could contribute two-thirds of the company’s share, driven by an expected tariff hike.  ', 'Jefferies added that it expects a fall in capital expenditure for Jio and the retail segment in FY25, a factor that is seen as instrumental in improving free cash flow and mitigating concerns surrounding a potential increase in net debt.

One can fix a stop loss of Rs 2,470.', '“Reliance Industries has gained quite significantly in the last two months after the descending channel breakout. At present, it has almost reached the previous peak zone of Rs 2,630 level, where it can find some resistance. The near-term support would be maintained near Rs 2,470 zone and only a decisive breach below this zone shall weaken the overall bias. At the same time, a decisive breach above the previous peak zone of Rs 2,630 should trigger a breakout for fresh targets of Rs 2,730 and Rs 2,850 levels, respectively, in the medium-term time frame,” said Koothupalakkal.', 'Disclaimer: Business Today provides stock market news for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice.

      "headings: [\"Reliance-Disney merger: Here's how the deal can fundamentally transform India's media and entertainment landscape\"]\n",
      "paragraphs: [\"Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) and The Walt Disney Company have agreed to merge their digital streaming and television assets in India, creating an $8.5-billion media behemoth spanning at least 100 channels across entertainment and sports, and two digital streaming platforms. The entity also has exclusive rights to sporting events like the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Disney films and productions in India, as well as a diverse international content library.\", 'The former rivals, who were locked in an intense battle over IPL rights until recently, have agreed to form a joint venture (JV) that will solidify RIL’s position in the Indian M&E space and reduce Disney’s presence in the country amid intense competition. \\xa0', 'This JV between RIL, its broadcast division Viacom 18 and Disney will bring together TV channels such as Colors, StarPlus, StarGOLD, Star Sports and Sports18 as well as streaming apps JioCinema and Disney+ Hotstar. The deal will combine the businesses of Viacom18 and Star India, where the media undertaking of Viacom18 will be merged into Star India Private Limited. The JV will be controlled by RIL. Under the terms of the deal, RIL will own 16.34%, Viacom18 will own 46.82%, while Disney’s share will be 36.84%. Disney may also contribute certain additional media assets to the JV, subject to regulatory and third-party approvals. RIL will invest Rs 11,500 crore (or approximately, $ 1.4 billion) into the JV for its growth strategy. Nita Ambani will be the Chairperson of the JV, while Uday Shankar, Co-founder of Bodhi Tree Systems, which owns a stake in Viacom18, will be the Vice Chairperson. Shankar, a former Disney India chief who has also led Star India, will provide overall strategic leadership.', '“Despite being the larger of the two, Disney’s Star India has seen its valuation drop to roughly $4 billion, accounting for the anticipated loss from its sports business,” says Abneesh Roy, Executive Director (Research), Nuvama Institutional Equities. Viacom18 was valued at roughly $4 billion when Reliance Industries and Bodhi Tree infused over Rs 15,000 crore into the company in April 2023, he adds. Initially, Disney reportedly valued the India business at around $10 billion, whereas Reliance’s valuation of the assets was a purported $7–8 billion.', 'Disney’s linear TV and streaming businesses in India have been hit over the past few years. Disney+ Hotstar, particularly, has bled 23 million subscribers since losing the IPL digital streaming rights to JioCinema. In fact, since mid-2022, Viacom18 has been collecting several properties that once had a home at Disney in India—whether it is the IPL digital rights, rights to bilateral India cricket matches or HBO content.', 'Vivek Menon, Managing Partner of media and entertainment debt fund NV Capital, notes that Disney has encountered a turbulent period on the global stage over the past few years. The company’s stock price has plummeted from a peak of $200 to about $100 now. “In India, they needed to pump additional capital because of the high cash burn on IPL broadcasting rights and Cricket World Cup rights on digital. A merger fits their strategy to conserve cash as well as dilute their holding to raise capital from their India franchise,” he adds. The merger marks Disney’s fourth avatar in India, following partnerships with the K.K. Modi Group in 1993 and Ronnie Screwvala’s UTV Software Communications in the mid-2000s. Disney’s expansion continued with the acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2018 for $71 billion, incorporating Indian operations under Disney Star (earlier Star India).', 'Analysts say the combined FY23 revenue of Rs 25,000 crore, which gives the merged company a 40% market share in linear TV and OTT sectors, could draw scrutiny from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) as the entity will become the single largest player in the field. The merger also reinforces their dominance in sports, with rights valued at nearly Rs 55,000 crore for major cricket properties over the next four to five years, projecting an 80-90% share of cricket advertising revenues in India. The deal also comes just before the commencement of IPL’s 2024 edition.', 'Uday Sodhi, former head of SonyLIV and Founding Partner of Kurate Digital Consulting, says JioCinema has aggregated content from HBO and NBC Universal. The merger will add Disney content also to the mix, he says, as the JV now has the licence to more than 30,000 Disney content assets. “This is great for the consumer. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and the other OTT players will have to now face a stronger competitor and will have to up their game,” he adds.', 'This is the second big-ticket merger in the Indian media and entertainment sector, following the high-profile announcement of a deal between Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (ZEEL) in September 2021. However, the Zee-Sony merger ultimately fell through last month, after numerous twists and turns.', 'Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

It has a ‘Buy’ rating on the RIL shares.', '   Reliance Industries has strategically invested in ten global technology innovators across New Energy verticals. These companies come with strong expertise that is likely to assist RIL accomplish its New Energy vision.

These strengths shall prove advantageous as the company embarks on large investments in all segments,\" Nuvama Equities said.\\xa0', '   It expects its consumer business (Digital and Retail) to contribute ~50% to EBITDA from FY25 given its strong expansion and customer base. It is now ascribing a rich valuation to JIO and Retail seeing their huge potential while remaining positive on the core O2C business (both refining and chemicals).\\xa0', '   “We believe refining margins in Asia would rise due to a ‘paradigm shift in regional refining dynamics’ from West to East, which are favourable for a complex refiner like Reliance.

Ebitda for the quarter stood at Rs 44,678 crore, up 16.7 per cent YoY while Ebitda margin at 18 per cent were up 210 basis points YoY.', 'RIL technical outlook', 'Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart said Reliance Industries has broken out of a multi-month consolidation pattern with a bullish Glag formation near its 20-day moving average (DMA).', '\"This technical setup suggests the potential for further upside towards the Rs 2,900 level. However, options data hints at some resistance near the Rs 2,800 strike price, as call writers seem confident at that level. Therefore, a decisive break above Rs 2,800 would be needed to overwhelm these call writers and fuel further gains. On the downside, the 20-DMA at 2650 acts as a strong support level,\" Meena said.', 'Also read: Top stocks of the week: IRFC, Rail Vikas Nigam, ONGC, Polycab India and more', 'Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

      "paragraphs: [\"Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), joined the elite club of centi-billionaires - global tycoons having a net worth of at least $100 billion. Ambani's wealth swelled after Reliance Industries Ltd hit new record highs on Thursday and other group companies rose sharply of late.\\nAccording to the data available with Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Mukesh Ambani added $2.76 billion in the previous trading session as his wealth stood at $102 billion. He currently stands at 12th spot. Mexican business magnate Carlos Slim is merely $1 billion ahead of Ambani. Bloomberg's Billionaires Index has only a dozen centi-billionaires.\\nShares of Reliance Industries gained about 3 per cent to Rs 2,724.95 during Thursday's trading session, before eventually settling at Rs 2,718.40, up 2.58 per cent. The total market capitalisation of RIL stood Rs 18.40 lakh crore mark. The stock is up 5 per cent in the last two trading sessions, while it has gained 12 per cent in the last one month.\\nRecently, the demerged NFBC Jio Financial Services (JFSL) also added to the recent rise in Mukesh Ambani’s fortunes. The NBFC gained more than 4.6 per cent to close Rs 251.50 on Thursday, with a total market capitalisation close to Rs 1.6 lakh crore on BSE.\\nOther listed entities from Ambani's kitty have also been on  a roll lately. Network18 Media Investment Ltd advanced another 10 per cent on Thursday to close at Rs 130.81. The media counter has rallied about 45 per cent in the year 2024 so far.\\nTV18 Broadcast Ltd managed to end higher on Thursday. The stock has gained more than 20 per cent in the last five trading sessions, with its mcap surpassing Rs 11,100 crore mark.  Similarly, Reliance Industrial Infrastructure Ltd (RIIL) gained over 7.2 per cent to Rs 1515.65. The stock is up about 35 per cent in a month.\\nFollowing the demerger of JFSL from RIL, Investors at Dalal Street are keenly awaiting the primary offerings of Reliance Retail and Jio Platforms, which have been hinted by Ambani in his speeches in the last few AGMs of the company. However, no official announcements have been made yet.\\nIn the Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, Tesla's Elon Musk continues to sit at top with a wealth of $212 billion. However, his wealth came down by $17 billion since the beginning of 2024. He is followed by Amazon's Jeff Bezos ($180 billion) and French business magnate Bernard Arnault ($164 billion). Among Indians, Gautam Adani is at 14th spot with a total wealth of $96.2 billion.\", 'Also read: Stock recommendations by analyst for January 12, 2024: RVNL, Exide Industries and LT Foods', 'Also read: YES Bank, Adani Power, Suzlon Energy: Trading strategies for for these buzzing stocks', 'Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

At present, it has almost reached the previous peak zone of Rs 2,630 level, where it can find some resistance. The near-term support would be maintained near Rs 2,470 zone and only a decisive breach below this zone shall weaken the overall bias. At the same time, a decisive breach above the previous peak zone of Rs 2,630 should trigger a breakout for fresh targets of Rs 2,730 and Rs 2,850 levels, respectively, in the medium-term time frame,” said Koothupalakkal.

      "paragraphs: [\"Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), India's most-valued company in terms of market capitalisation (m-cap) soared 7 per cent in Monday's trade to hit record high level. The oil-to-telecom major in fact added Rs 1.20 lakh crore to its m-cap intraday, hitting Rs 19,53,253.43 crore today from Rs 18,33,737.60 crore on Thursday. The rise in shares of RIL was accompanied by high turnover, with the scrip seeing Rs 2,832.59 crore worth RIL shares changing hands on NSE in the day so far.  \", 'RIL shares soared 6.99 per cent to hit a high of Rs 2,900 on BSE. Reliance Industries, along with ONGC, helped the BSE Oil & Gas index rally 4.8 per cent intraday, with technical charts turning positive on the index.', 'Reliance Industries is Nomura India’s top pick in the oil & gas sector. The brokerage noted that the outlook for RIL across segments remains optimistic. It said growth of consumer businesses remains robust: Reliance Retail underpinned by store additions, strong growth of digital/ new commerce and operating leverage; and Jio underpinned by tariff hikes post central elections and robust growth of subscriber additions with steady growth of market share. ', 'Besides, the foreign brokerage in a recent note said the O2C segment will benefit from strong global oil demand growth of over 1.2mn b/d in 2024 and upstream has ramped up strongly and will continue its strong performance in FY25.', 'RIL will further benefit from its robust FCF generation of Rs 30,000 crore in FY25F, declining capex levels to about Rs 1.25 lakh crore and declining debt levels to Rs 2.7 lakh crore, Nomura India said.', '\"The latest breakout in the oil and gas index has propelled the sector into positive territory. The recent consolidation in the Nifty Oil and Gas index concluded with an upside breakout, indicating an increased optimism in the space that may persist in the coming days. Therefore, the sudden surge in energy stocks might continue to bolster the headline index in the short term,\" said Rupak De, Senior Technical  Analyst, LKP Securities.', 'Also read: Hot stocks on January 29: IREDA, SBI Cards, IRB Infra, IRFC and more    ', 'Also read: Adani Enterprises: Here’s what to expect from Adani group shares a year after Hindenburg report ', 'Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

      "paragraphs: ['Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) fell less than 1 per cent lower on Saturday, with the most-valued stock on Dalal Street losing Rs 13,400 crore in market capitalisation for the day, as investors turned cautious at the fag end of the session. A couple of brokerages tracking the stock have target prices in the range of Rs 2,900-3,200.  The scrip settled at Rs 2,715.25 on BSE, down 0.72 per cent.', 'Centrum Broking said Reliance Industries’ Q3FY24 operating performance was marginally muted sequentially impacted by subdued performance by O2C segment, which was made up by good performance by other segments, particularly the Oil & Gas segment.', '\"Lower fuel cracks and polymer deltas led to 13.6 per cent QoQ drop in O2C Ebitda, further impacted by lower throughput due to planned shutdown during the quarter. Increase in Oil & Gas production led to 21.8 per cent QoQ and 49.6 per cent surge in Oil & Gas segment Ebitda. Jio Platforms (Digital) added 11.2mn new subscribers, highest in recent quarters while ARPU remained flattish. Capex momentum subsided substantially QoQ. 5G rollout was completed in Q3 as planned,\" it said.', \"The domestic brokerage maintained its 'BUY' on Reliance Industries with a target price of Rs 3,299 from Rs 3,330 earlier.

Telecom and retail are likely to drive earnings over the next two years.', '\"RIL announced the start-up of new energy factories by the end of the current year, clearing the likely announcement of its next phase of investment. Maintain BUY with a target of Rs 3,005,\" the brokerage said.', \"Antique said while O2C performance was weak, the big jump in oil & gas along with the strong retail, and to some extent telecom performance made up for the sequential decline. RIL's third quarter profit was largely in line with its estimates, it said.\", \"Prabhudas Lilladher said the RIL stock is trading at 10.8 times FY26E Ebitda. It maintained its 'Accumulate' rating on the stock with a target of Rs 2,912, valuing the standalone business at 7.5 times FY26 Ebitda, Jio at 15 times FY26 Ebitda and Retail at 39 times FY26 Ebitda.\", 'Meanwhile, Emkay Global said Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) quarter results were largely in-line with its estimates. It said oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business and Reliance Jio Ebitda, both saw a slight miss on estimates but were offset by better Upstream and in-line Reliance Retail numbers.', '\"We broadly maintain FY24-26E earnings, but raise our SOTP-based target price by 8 per cent to Rs 2,950 per share, on the back of higher new energy value (1.5 times EV/IC) as development progresses (giga factory commission, green H₂ PLI win for 90ktpa, etc), higher Jio EV/Ebitda target (11 times versus 10.5 times earlier on strong subscriber growth, peer rerating), and rollover to December 2024 earnings estimates,\" it said while suggesting an \\'ADD\\' rating on the stock.', 'Also read: Top stocks of the week: IRFC, Rail Vikas Nigam, ONGC, Polycab India and more', 'Also read: RVNL shares hit 10% upper price band; check revised target price & other details', 'Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

RIL said it restated figures for the year-ago period to reflect demerger of financial services business.', 'Ebitda for the quarter came in at Rs 44,678 crore, up 16.7 per cent YoY, with Ebitda margin at 18 per cent, up 210 basis points YoY.', 'Reliance Industries said its O2C Ebitda was weak because of planned maintenance and inspection shutdown. Reliance Industries said its Revenue for JPL increased 11.4 per cent YoY, led by robust subscriber growth across mobility and homes, and benefit of mix improvement in ARPU.', 'Revenue for Reliance Retail grew 22.8 per cent YoY with strong growth across all consumption baskets. Grocery reported 41 per cent growth, followed by Fashion & Lifestyle (28 per cent) and Consumer Electronics (19 per cent). O2C revenue declined 2.4 per cent, primarily on account of lower price realisation led by 5.3 per cent Yo-Y decline in average brent crude oil prices. Revenue from Oil & Gas segment jumped significantly mainly on account of higher volumes partly offset by lower gas price realisation from KG D6 field.', 'RIL said its key Ebitda growth contributors included a 11.5 per cent YoY increase in JPL Ebitda with higher revenue and increase in margins. The oil-to-telecom major said Reliance Retail recorded 31.1 per cent increase in Ebitda led by record footfalls amid festive season. Ebitda margin for the Mulesh AMbani-led company improved 50 basis points to 8.4 per cent, thanks to operating leverage and continued focus on cost management initiatives.', '\"Sustained performance in the O2C segment with higher gasoline cracks and advantageous feedstock sourcing. This was partially offset by lower downstream chemical margins and planned maintenance and inspection shutdown. Planned maintenance and inspection shutdown of CDU, FCCU, Delayed Coking and ROGC complex impacted yields and profitability. O2C Ebitda would have been higher on YoY and comparable on QoQ basis if all major units were available during the quarter. Oil and Gas segment Ebitda increased sharply by 49.6 per cent, led by 72.6 per cent higher gas and condensate production from KG D6 block,\" it said.', 'Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani  said Reliance delivered another quarter of robust operating and financial performance, with Jio completing the fastest rollout of True 5G services in India. ', '\"The strong uptake of the JioBharat phone and JioAirFiber services has resulted in continued expansion of Jio’s subscriber base, contributing to the stellar growth numbers of the digital services business. The retail segment has also delivered an impressive financial performance with its rapidly expanding physical as well as digital footprint. Reliance Retail remains focused on enriching customer shopping experience by adding new brands and offerings to its portfolio,\" he said.', '\"The Oil & Gas segment posted its highest ever quarterly Ebitda. I am happy to note that KG D6 is now contributing 30% of India’s gas production, fueling its transition towards a greener and cleaner tomorrow. The O2C segment delivered resilient performance aided by operational flexibility and strong domestic demand. Staying true to its commitment to sustainability, Reliance has become the first Indian company to chemically recycle pyrolysis oil into circular polymers,\" he said.', 'Besides, the New Energy Giga Complex is all set to be commissioned in the second half of 2024, Ambani said.  ', '\"I am confident that Reliance’s New Energy business will play a pivotal role in the global movement for adoption of cleaner fuels,” he added.', \"On Friday, RIL's scrip on BSE closed trading nearly flat at Rs 2,736.45.\", 'In the case of Reliance Jio, ARPU came in at Rs 181.70. Analysts were largely expecting ARPU at Rs 183. Jio said its subscriber base rose to 47.09 crore in Q3 from 45.97 crore in the Q2.', 'Meanwhile, RIL said global oil demand rose 1.7 million barrels per day YoY to 102 million barrels per day due to higher demand mainly from America and Asia. Jet/Kero and Gasoline each posted strong demand growth YoY at 1 million barrel per day while diesel demand declined 0.2 million barrels per day .', '\"Dated Brent averaged $84 per barrel, down $4.7 million per barrel. Crude oil benchmarks declined YoY due to concerns of global economic slowdown and seasonal lower demand. Crude supply remained adequate despite headline production cuts by OPEC+ countries. Global refinery crude throughput was higher by 0.5 mb/d Y-o-Y while it declined by 1.7 mb/d QoQ to 81.7 mb/d in 3Q FY24,\" it said.', 'Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.
